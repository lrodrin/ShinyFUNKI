## Welcome to the FUNKI application
FUNKI is a multi-omic functional integration and analysis platform. It provides a standardize pipeline to process and perform functional analysis on transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic and metabolomic datasets. The analysis can be performed both on a single type of omic data and on multi-omic dataset by integrating them in supervised and unsupervised manners.

### Implemented Approaches
FUNKI is still under development, and the following approaches are implemented or in the process of being implemented.

#### PROGENy
[PROGENy](https://saezlab.github.io/progeny/) is a linear model to infer pathway activity from gene expression data. Pathway activities are calculated based on consensus gene signatures obtained from perturbation experiments, that is, the footprint of pathway on gene expression. More coming soon...
